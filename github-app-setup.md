Here is the updated README with "localtunnel" replaced by "Ngrok" and the description fixed accordingly:

# Setting Up a GitHub App for Your Organization

This guide provides a streamlined process to set up a GitHub App for your organization. For detailed documentation, please visit [Registering a GitHub App on GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app#registering-a-github-app).

## Getting Started

1. **Access Developer Settings**: 
   - Click your profile photo in the upper-right corner of any GitHub page.
   - Navigate to "Your organizations" and select the relevant organization.
   - Click "Settings", then select "Developer settings" from the left sidebar.

2. **Create New GitHub App**:
   - In the "Developer settings" menu, click "GitHub Apps".
   - Select "New GitHub App".

3. **Configure App Settings**:
   - Enter a unique **App Name**. Ensure it is clear and concise. This name will appear in lowercase, with spaces replaced by `-`, and without special characters in the user interface.
   - Provide a short **Description** of what your app does (optional).
   - Specify your app's **Homepage URL**. Use the URL of the public repository where your app's code is stored if you do not have a dedicated website.
   - If your app requires user authorization, add one or more **Callback URLs** where users will be redirected after authorization (optional).
   - To keep user access tokens from expiring automatically, you can choose to deselect **Expire user authorization tokens**. However, it's generally safer to keep tokens short-lived for security reasons.
   - If your app needs to act on behalf of users, select **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation**.

4. **Permissions and Events**:
   - Under "Permissions" > "Repository permissions" > "Metadata", select "Read-only". This is crucial for accessing repository metadata without write permissions.
   - In the "Subscribe to events" section, ensure that the **Push** event is selected. This will enable your app to receive webhook events for push operations to the repository.

5. **Webhook Configuration**:
   - Choose to keep the app **Active** to receive webhook events.
   - Enter your **Webhook URL**, to which GitHub will send webhook events. This URL will be generated by the Flask app using [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). (You can leave the URL blank during the initial setup.)
   - **Generate a Webhook Secret** and share it with CAST for added security. This secret token is used to validate received webhooks.
   - Select whether to **Enable SSL verification** for the webhook.

6. **Advanced Settings**:
   - Provide a **Setup URL** if your app requires additional steps post-installation (optional).
   - If your app requires a private key for signing access token requests, ensure you generate and securely store this **Private Key**.

7. **Finalize App Registration**:
   - Choose where the GitHub App can be installed: opt for "Only on this account" for organization-level apps.
   - Click "Create GitHub App".

Your GitHub App is now configured and ready for installation in your organization!

## Post-Setup Actions

After setting up your GitHub App, ensure to:
- Install the app in your organization.
- Securely store the generated private key and webhook secret.
