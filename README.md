# My-Github-App Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Before setting up **My-Github-App**, ensure the following are installed on your local machine:

1. **Git**: Required for cloning the My-Github-App repository. Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
   
2. **Python**: This application is built using Python (Flask framework). Ensure Python (preferably version 3) is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. **pip**: The Python package installer. Pip should come pre-installed with Python versions 3.4 and above. Use the following command to install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask pandas requests fasteners openpyxl waitress
    ```

4. **ngrok**: Required to expose your local server to the internet for webhook events. No manual setup is needed as the `app.py` script will automatically use the ngrok executable included in the repository, which was originally downloaded from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).

5. **Excel**: The application requires an Excel file (`app_map.xlsx`) for repository mapping. Ensure you have Excel or a compatible spreadsheet tool to create or edit this file.

6. **Install GitHub App**: Install the CAST GitHub app from the GitHub Marketplace at the repository or organization level. You can find it here: [GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/gitrepofetcher).

Once these prerequisites are met, proceed with the setup instructions below.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Download the CAST GitHub Automator
Download the latest stable release of the CAST GitHub Automator from the following link: [CAST GitHub Automator Releases](https://github.com/hbe-cast/my-github-app/releases). Make sure to select a production-ready version for your setup.

### 2. Downloading the Highlight Command Line Interface (HL CLI)
Download the HL CLI from the [official download page](https://doc.casthighlight.com/product-tutorials-third-party-tools/automated-code-scan-command-line/).

### 3. Configuring the Application
Update the `config.json` file with the required values. Ensure that all fields are filled out correctly to prevent issues during runtime.

### 4. Setting Up `ngrok-config.yaml`
Ensure that the `ngrok-config.yaml` file is properly configured with the correct values for the `authtoken` and `domain`, provided by the CAST Team. This file is crucial for exposing your local application to the internet. Make sure the `addr` is set to the correct port (e.g., `5001`) as used by your Flask app.

### 5. Running the Application
Navigate to the `My-Github-App` directory in a terminal and start the application with the following command:
```bash
waitress-serve --port=5001 app:app
```

### 6. Establishing a Public Endpoint
In a new terminal window, navigate to the same directory and create a public URL using ngrok with this command:
```bash
ngrok http --domain=CAST_NGROK_DOMAIN 5001 --config=path/to/your/ngrok-config.yaml
```
This command exposes your Flask application to the internet, enabling GitHub to trigger webhook events.

### 7. Preparing the Repository Mapping File
Ensure that an Excel file named `app_map.xlsx` is located in the `My-Github-App` directory. The file should follow this format:

| app_name      | troux_id    | gh_url                                      |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| GitCloner     | 7E876-879YUP| https://github.com/hbe-cast/GitCloner       |
| GitCloner1    | 7E876-879YUP| https://github.com/hbe-cast/GitCloner_1     |
| WebGoat_test  | 87GHY-123HJ | https://github.com/hbe-cast/WebGoat_test    |

**Note**: Repositories without a `troux_id` will not be cloned, and the application will stop.

### 8. Triggering Scans
Whenever changes are pushed to a repository where the GitHub App is installed, an event will be triggered. This event will clone the repository to your local machine and initiate a scan using the HL CLI. The results will be uploaded to the Highlight instance specified in the `config.json` file.

## Summary of the GitHub App

The **My-Github-App** integrates a GitHub App with a Flask-based web application, automating the cloning of repositories into a designated directory on your machine when a "push" event occurs.

### How It Works:

1. **GitHub App Setup**: A GitHub App is created and configured with the necessary permissions to access repository contents. It listens for "push" events in repositories where the App is installed.
   
2. **Webhook Configuration**: The GitHub App sends event notifications to a public URL (provided by `ngrok`) which points to the Flask application. For local development, ngrok is used to expose the local server to the internet.

3. **Event Handling**: When a push event occurs, GitHub sends a webhook event containing the repository's clone URL to the Flask app.

4. **Verification**: The Flask app verifies the webhook event's authenticity using a shared secret (webhook secret) set in the GitHub App configuration.

5. **Cloning Operation**: Once verified, the Flask app extracts the repository's clone URL and executes the `git clone` operation to clone the repository to a specified directory on the machine.

### Architecture Overview:

- **GitHub App**: Acts as the interface between GitHub repositories and the Flask app. It listens for push events and sends notifications via webhooks.
  
- **Flask Application**: A webhook server that processes webhook events, verifies them, and performs cloning operations.

- **ngrok**: Provides a publicly accessible URL for the Flask app, making it accessible from the internet for GitHub webhook events.

- **File System**: The directory where repositories are cloned. Each repository is cloned into a unique subdirectory based on its name.

### Key Components:

- **Webhook Secret**: Secures communication between GitHub and the Flask app by verifying the authenticity of webhook events.

- **`repo_config.json`**: Contains configuration parameters, such as the base directory for cloning operations.

- **Cloning Logic**: Embedded within the Flask app, responsible for cloning repositories upon validated push events.
